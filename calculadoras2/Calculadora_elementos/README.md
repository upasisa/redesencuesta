# element-calc
element-calc is a molecular mass calculator in the form of a responsive periodic table.
It uses the [Mendeleev](https://github.com/nickroberts404/Mendeleev) package to access element data, parse user input into compounds, and perform operations on compounds.

Data from Mendeleev comes from the [IUPAC](http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AtWt/)

#### Future Plans
I'd like to build compound recognition/search into the table. I've already scraped around 2,000 compounds into a JSON file useable by [Mendeleev](https://github.com/nickroberts404/Mendeleev).
